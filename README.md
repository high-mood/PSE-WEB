# Description
The goal of this project is to obtain a user’s Spotify history and from that deduce information about theindividual.   The  data  that  played  tracks  can  give  us  about  the  user  is  the  result  of  classification  usingmachine learning.  From that we may deduce the mood of a user at a specific time,  and see correlationswithin their music history.  Furthermore, besides just presenting information, this project improves uponSpotify’s recommendations by giving recommendations based upon not only played tracks, but the mood ofthese tracks.  Besides just being of benefit to a user, this product can also be of interest to companies.  Forexample:  advertising or (maliciously) infringing on the user’s autonomy by attempting to alter their moodthrough our recommendations.
